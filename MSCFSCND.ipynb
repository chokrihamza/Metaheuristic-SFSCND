    "# Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The current supply chain (SSC) network comprises various entities, including fish producers originating from\n",
    "both fishery and aquaculture sectors, Processing Plants, Canning Factories, Wholesalers, Fish waste collectors, Waste\n",
    "Processing Factory, poultry and livestock food markets, and customers.\n",
    "In the forward flow, illustrated in Figure 2, captured or aquacultured fish are transported from the production\n",
    "\n",
    "sites (fishery and aquacultures) to the processing centers and factories, depending on their production capacities.\n",
    "At the processing centers, the fish undergo essential processes such as cleaning, gutting, filleting, and deboning.\n",
    "Subsequently, the fish are forwarded to factories where further processes such as Filleting, Cooking, Filling, Adding\n",
    "Liquid or Sauce, Sealing, Sterilization, and Cooling take place. Following this, the factories and processing units\n",
    "transport the finished products to wholesalers. The wholesalers then distribute the finished products to end customers,\n",
    "which include retailers, Fishmongers, Supermarkets, and Hypermarkets.\n",
    "In the reverse logistic flow, waste and the deteriorated quantity of fish generated by customers are collected by\n",
    "collector centers. For other actors in the chain, waste and the deterioration rates of the fish are transported directly to\n",
    "waste factories for transformation into powder suitable for poultry and livestock markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "The following assumptions are set in the proposed supply chain network:\n",
    "1. The model is a single-period, single-product mixed integer linear programming model.\n",
    "2. Waste is generated by processing centers, factories, and customers.\n",
    "3. The deterioration quantities can be generated by fishers, aquaculture farmers, wholesalers, and customers.\n",
    "4. The locations of the fisheries, aquacultures, customers, by-products markets are considered fixed. On the other\n",
    "hand, the processing centers, factories, wholesalers, collector centers, and waste powder factories are assumed as\n",
    "potential locations.\n",
    "5. Market and by-product market demand must be satisfied\n",
